# This experiment config file defines parameter variations for running experiments
# across multiple configurations. It is linked to three main config files:
# - config.yaml: Contains settings for training data, wallet cohorts, and data cleaning.
# - modeling_config.yaml: Contains preprocessing steps and modeling-related parameters.
# - metrics_config.yaml: Defines metrics and their aggregations for evaluation.
