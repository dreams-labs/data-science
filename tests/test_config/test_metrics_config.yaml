# Available Commands:
# aggregations:
#     - "sum", "mean", "median", "min", "max", "std"
# rolling stats:
#     - "sum", "mean", "median", "max", "min", "std"
# comparisons:
#     - "change", "pct_change", "difference"
# window_duration:
#     - Specifies the number of days per rolling window (e.g., 7 means a 7-day rolling window)
# lookback_periods:
#     - Defines how many periods to look back when calculating rolling stats (e.g., 8 means calculate rolling stats over 8 previous periods)
