  # Modeling period filters
  min_modeling_investment: 1000

  # Wallet minimum thresholds
  minimum_wallet_inflows: 50000 # The amount of lifetime USD inflows a wallet must have to be included in the training data
  minimum_volume: 1000  # Exclude wallets with fewer than this amount of training period USD volume
  minumum_coins_traded: 3  # Exclude wallets that have traded fewer coins than this during the training period

  # Wallet maximum thresholds
  profitability_filter: 25000000  # Exclude wallets with profits or losses greater than or equal to this amount (USD)
  inflows_filter: 25000000  # Exclude wallets with inflows greater than or equal to this amount (USD)

  # market_data_df filters: Define how to handle missing price data
  max_gap_days: 50  # Maximum consecutive missing days to fill in price gaps (e.g., price interpolation for gaps up to 2 days)
  min_daily_volume: 5000 # Minimum average daily volume the coin must have
