# Variables used to clean and filter raw data before training data is built
data_cleaning:

    # Market data filters
    max_initial_market_cap: 999150_000_000  # coins above this market cap as of the start of the training period will be removed from all datasets
    max_gap_days: 50  # Maximum consecutive missing days to fill in price gaps (e.g., price interpolation for gaps up to 2 days)
    min_daily_volume: 500 # Minimum average daily volume the coin must have


# Variables used for comnverting the wallet scores into coin forecasts
coin_validation_analysis:

    # Forecasting methods
    top_n: 5  # how many of the top coins of a given sort method will be included in performance assessments
    sort_method: "top_wallet_balance_pct"  # which coin wallet metric to use for coin forecast rankings

    # Thresholds for coin inclusion in forecasts
    min_wallets: 3  # how many wallets must hold a coin for the coin to be elegible for forecasting
    min_balance: 10000  # how much USD all wallets must hold for the coin to be elegible for forecasting
