# These params determine what timing features are populated to create
#  features such as buy_weighted/sell_weighted averages of the metric.
# Offsets will calculate these as of x days ahead/behind of the buy or sell.
#
# Example
# -------
# btc_vdd_multiple:
#     offsets: [-15, 30]
#     retain_base_columns: True
#
# This will output the average VDD on transaction dates, as well as the average
#  VDD 15 days prior to transactions and 30 days after transactions.
#
# The features will be structured as:
# timing|btc_vdd_multiple/lag_15/*
# timing|btc_vdd_multiple/lead_30/*
# timing|btc_vdd_multiple/* (included because retain_base_columns==True)
#
#
# If the offset value would exceed the training period boundary, it will be
#  recorded as None to avoid data leakage.
#
# All offsets keys must be included in wallets_metrics_config.time_series
